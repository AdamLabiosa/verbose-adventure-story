In an land far far away, there once was a penguin named Pumpkin. He would walk around his lonely ice town every single day looking for his friends that went missing years before. 
Every day he wakes up with unbrittled optimism hoping that they will be back. So far, he has had no luck.
But today would be different. On the way to get his morning coffee, he spotted something peculiar. He saw the flash of a bright red scarf as he turned the corner - the last gift he gave his friend before he was lost. Could it be him?
